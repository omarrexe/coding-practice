# My Coding Solutions
This is where I keep track of my solutions from LeetCode and HackerRank. I'm using it to stay motivated, track my progress, and see how I improve over time.

## Structure
Solutions are organized by language and platform:
- `/SQL` - SQL problems and queries
- `/Python` - Python challenges and algorithms

Feel free to explore, but this is primarily for my own learning journey.
